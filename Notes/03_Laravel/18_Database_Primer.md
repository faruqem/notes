## Intro
Databases are an essential component of most web applications; having a database allows your web application to have &ldquo;memory&rdquo; over time by storing data that is easily retrieved and manipulated.

Databases consist of **tables**. For example, you might have a table to keep track of *users* that have accounts on your site.

Each table is like a spreadsheet, with **fields** (aka **columns**) describing your data (e.g. username, email, first name, last name) and **rows** which hold that data.

Laravel makes it convenient to connect to a variety of database types:

+ MySQL
+ SQLite
+ PostgreSQL
+ SQL Server

(If interested, [here's an article on the differences between these database types](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems))

In this course, we'll be using the __MySQL database__.




## Your local database
In addition to providing you with an Apache server, MAMP and XAMPP also provide you with MySQL database functionality.

Now's a good time to make sure MySQL is running in MAMP/XAMPP:

If MySQL is not running refer to these notes: [Debugging your local server](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2016-notes/blob/master/01_Servers_and_Git/02_Debugging_local_servers.md).




## Working with your database
There are a few ways you can interact with your MySQL database:

1. Via a database manager such as phpMyAdmin
2. Via MySQL command line
3. Via your application code

In these notes we're going to give a sample of all of the above.




## phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin is a __web-based MySQL database manager__ that comes with MAMP and XAMPP by default. It's also a common tool on shared web servers, and can be installed on virtual servers like the ones we use on DigitalOcean.

To visit phpMyAdmin on MAMP or XAMPP go to **<http://localhost/phpmyadmin>**.

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:1089px; width:100%' alt='phpMyAdmin Screenshot'>

As an alternative to phpMyAdmin, you can also download a desktop database application; here are some suggestions:

+ Mac: [SequelPro](http://www.sequelpro.com/)
+ Windows: [HeidiSQL](http://www.heidisql.com/)




## New database
In phpMyAdmin, find the __Database tab__ and create a new database.

We'll call ours `foobooks`.

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-create-new-database@2x.png' style='max-width:862px; width:100%' alt='Creating a new database in phpMyAdmin'>

After you create your database, select it from the list of databases on the left so you can begin interacting with that database, including adding your first table.

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-select-foobooks@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:1724px; width:100%' alt='Selecting the foobooks database'>




## Practice data / our first table
Continuing with our Foobooks example, one of the logical first __tables__ our application will be a books table.

Here is a sample list of books we can practice with:

+ __The Great Gatsby__
    + id: 1
    + title: The Great Gatsby
    + author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
	+ tags: novel,fiction,classic,wealth
    + published: 1925
	+ cover: http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9780743273565_p0_v4_s114x166.JPG
	+ purchase_link: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-great-gatsby-francis-scott-fitzgerald/1116668135?ean=9780743273565
+ __The Bell Jar__
    + id: 2
    + title: The Bell Jar    
	+ author: Sylvia Plath
	+ tags: novel,fiction,classic,women
	+ published: 1963
	+ cover: http://img1.imagesbn.com/p/9780061148514_p0_v2_s114x166.JPG
	+ purchase_link: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bell-jar-sylvia-plath/1100550703?ean=9780061148514
+ __I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings__
    + id: 3
    + title: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
	+ author: Maya Angelou
	+ tags: autobiography,nonfiction,classic,women
	+ published: 1969
	+ cover: http://img1.imagesbn.com/p/9780345514400_p0_v1_s114x166.JPG
	+ purchase_link: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-maya-angelou/1100392955?ean=9780345514400

Note that each book contains the following data:

1. id
2. title
3. author
4. tags
5. published
6. cover (link to an image of the cover of the book)
7. purchase link

These above data points will be the __fields__ in our books table.

For all our tables/fields, we'll follow these suggested naming conventions:

+ Table names are plural.
+ Tables and field names are written in snake_case.




## New table
In phpMyAdmin, create your first table in the `foobooks` database, named `books`. Set the `Number of columns` to be 7.

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-new-books-table@2x.png' style='max-width:715px; width:100%' alt='Create the new books table in phpMyAdmin'>

After naming your table, you'll be prompted on the next screen to design your table:

1. What are the fields in the table?
2. What data types should be use for each field?

Looking at the example data above, we came up with the following design:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-books-table-design@2x.png' style='max-width:480px; width:100%' alt='books table design'>

To understand the **MySQL data types** chosen for each field in this table, [visit this reference of common MySQL data types](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2016-notes/blob/master/03_Laravel/20_Common_MySQL_Data_Types.md).

In phpMyAdmin, this is what the above `books` table design looks like:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-design-books-table@2x.png' style='max-width:974px; width:100%' alt='books table built in phpMyAdmin'>


### Length/Values
In the `Length/Values` setting, you can (and sometimes have to) set the max length for data stored in that field.

The `Length/Values` setting is set to 255 for our `VARCHAR` fields. This number was chosen because it is the max amount of characters you can put in a `VARCHAR` field. If you needed to store something that required more characters than that, you should choose a different data type. When using `VARCHAR` you *have* to set a `Length/Value`.

For the `published` field, which is an `INT`, we set the `Length/Value` to be 4 with the expectation that we would store a 4 character representation of the year, e.g. `1998` or `2015`.


### Primary Index / Auto Increment
Note how the first field, `id` was set to be the **Primary Index** (aka **Primary Key**) and **AI (Auto Increment)** was checked. This is important. Every table should start with an `id` field that has these characteristics.

Setting the `id` field as the Primary key will come into play when you form relationships between tables and also when you create indexes to optimize queries.

Setting the `id` field to auto-increment will make MySQL generate a new, unique id for every row that gets entered into this table.


### Save your new table
After you're done entering the settings for your new `books` table, save your work, and now you should see this new table listed in the menu on the left below the `foobooks` database name.




## SQL
*Note: The following section is FYI only; no action is required.*

MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server all rely on **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, a language designed for interacting with **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**.

The actions we've done thus far in phpMyAdmin could have actually be completed with SQL commands, run either via MySQL Command Line, or via the *SQL* tab in phpMyAdmin.

Essentially phpMyAdmin is a visual abstraction for SQL commands, giving you an interface to enter info which the program then converts to SQL commands to run against your database.

For example, when you created the database `foobooks`, phpMyAdmin built and ran this SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE foobooks;
```

The SQL equivalent of clicking on `foobooks` from the left menu would be this SQL command:

```sql
USE foobooks;
```

And when you created the table, the SQL command was this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    published INT(4),
    cover VARCHAR(255),
    purchase_link VARCHAR(255)
);
```



## New rows
To create a new row in the `books` table, i.e. add your first book, you could do it via the *Insert* tab in phpMyAdmin:

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-insert-new-book@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:949px; width:100%' alt=''>

Or you could run the following SQL command:

```sql
INSERT INTO `foobooks`.`books`
(`id`, `title`, `author`, `published`, `cover`, `purchase_link`, `tags`)
VALUES (
    NULL,
    'The Great Gatsby',
    'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
    '1925',
    'http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9780743273565_p0_v4_s114x166.JPG',
    'http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-great-gatsby-francis-scott-fitzgerald/1116668135?ean=9780743273565',
    'novel,fiction,classic,wealth'
    );
```

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-insert-new-book-with-sql@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:776px; width:100%' alt='Creating a new book with a SQL command'>




## Reading data
In the above examples we made a table, and took a look at some data creation techniques. Now lets look at some data reading techniques.

Here's an SQL command that would fetch all the rows in the `books` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
```

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-phpmyadmin-select-all-books@2x.png' class='' style='max-width:1089px; width:100%' alt=''>

Here's an SQL command that would fetch all the rows from the `books` table where the author name included the word &ldquo;Scott&rdquo;:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author LIKE '%Scott%'
```

Alternatively you could have achieved the same results by exploring the *Search* tab in phpMyAdmin.

The above SQL commands are pretty human readable, so you should get the gist of what they're doing, but take a moment to skim over this [SQL Cheat Sheet](http://www.sql.su/) to see the variety of commands that SQL has.




## Executing SQL from your applications
The above methods of interacting with your database all come from the perspective of you, the developer.

Obviously, though, you'll want to begin writing code and building features in your application that let it tap into your database.

In PHP, one way you can tap into a MySQL database using the [mysqli extension](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.statements.php).

Here's an example of a simple PHP script that connects to a database (`foobooks`) and then runs a SQL query against a table in this database (`SELECT * FROM books`):

```php
# Step 1) Connect to the database
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "root", "foobooks");
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
 	echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: (" . $mysqli->connect_errno . ") " . $mysqli->connect_error;
}

# Step 2) Run a query
$books = $mysqli->query("SELECT * FROM books");

# Step 3) Loop through results
$books->data_seek(0);
while ($book = $books->fetch_assoc()) {
 	echo $book['title']." was written by ".$book['author']."<br>";
}
```

The above code is the approach we'd use if we were writing &ldquo;plain PHP&rdquo; without a framework like Laravel. You don't have to get this code working, just skim through it for the general idea.




## Enter Laravel...
Everything described thus far is roughly what you'd do if you were interacting with a database without the utilities Laravel provides.

However, because database interaction is such an essential aspect of application development, Laravel gives us many tools to make the job easier.

Here's just some of the examples of the benefits Laravel provides for database interaction:

+ Manage one or more database connections.
+ Environment specific database management.
+ Abstraction which provides the ability to easily switch between database types.
+ Automatically protects against [SQL Injection Attacks](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png).
+ Object mapping - the ability to easily connect the Objects of your application to rows in a table.
+ Migrations - Scripts to manage your database tables.
+ Seeding - Scripts to pre-fill your database tables.


From this point forward we're going to look at database interaction from the perspective of Laravel which is going to abstract a lot of the SQL-related work we did above. Despite this, it's still useful to have a foundational SQL understanding so you better understand what Laravel is doing beneath the surface.

## Summary
The above notes covered a lot of background information to help you understand how MySQL databases work. To recap on just the actionable steps, though, here's what we did:

1. Created a new database called `foobooks` using phpMyAdmin.
2. In this database, created a new table called `books`.
3. Entered at least one book into this new table, using the *Insert* tab in phpMyAdmin.




## Tip: Via MySQL Command Line
If you want to bypass phpMyAdmin, you can interact directly with MySQL from the command line using MySQL's executable.

Launch MySQL from MAMP:

```
$ /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -uroot -proot
```

Launch MySQL from XAMPP:

```bash
$ C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe --user=root --password=
```

Once you're in mysql mode you should see a prompt that looks like this:

```bash
mysql >
```

At this prompt, you can type any SQL command. For example, here's a command to show all the databases on your system:

```bash
mysql > SHOW DATABASES;
```

End your statement with a semi-colon; this tells MySQL you're done so it can execute the line.

This command lets you select the `foobooks` database.

```bash
mysql > USE foobooks;
```

See all the tables:
```bash
mysql > SHOW TABLES;
```

Now you can practice any of the commands covered above, such as selecting books:
```bash
mysql > SELECT * FROM books;
```

Hit CTRL-C when you're done to exit MySQL.

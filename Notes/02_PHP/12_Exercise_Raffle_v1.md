Let's put our `$contestants` array to use for the aforementioned Raffle app.

Here are the specifications of this app:

* You have the same 4, hard-coded contestants every time (we'll improve on this in v2).
* Your contestant names are Sam, Eliot, Liz and Max.
* Every time the browser refreshes, the program will randomly determine whether each contestant is either a loser or winner.
* It's okay to have more than one winner or loser at a time.
* Use PHP's [__rand()__](http://us2.php.net/rand) function to help pick your winner(s).
* [Here's the final app in action](http://php.wcc-hosting.com/raffle).

## Challenge
If you're looking for an extra challenge, you can add these features to your app:

* If no winner was selected, print a message that says `<em>No winners this round :(</em>`
* If more than one winner is selected, print a message that says `<em>It's a tie!</em>`
* What other features can you think to add?

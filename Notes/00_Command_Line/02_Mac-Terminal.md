On Macs, Bash shell is accessed via an included application called **Terminal**.

Find it in `/Users/ComputerName/Applications/Utilities/` or just type `Terminal` into Spotlight.

The following instructions show some customizations you can do with Terminal. Implementing these changes are not required for this course, but doing so will teach you some neat tricks, and give you practice interacting with CL.

## Customizing

There are many customizations you can make to your Command Line program that will make your day-to-day use easier.

For example, you can configure...

+ your prompt (i.e., the line you see where you enter commands)
+ the message you see when you first open Terminal
+ aliases you can use to make long commands shorter
+ your PATH variable

Our first configurations will be made via the file `~/.bashrc`.

We're going to provide you with a template `.bashrc` file you can start with and customize as needed.

[Go here to copy the .bashrc template](https://gist.github.com/susanBuck/ee3a0a53d72198c1a244) (Click the *Raw* button to get just the plain text contents for easy copying).

Next, open `~/.bashrc` with *nano*, a command line text editor. That's done with the command `nano` which we'll prefix with `sudo` in order to open the file as an administrator:

```bash
$ sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

At this point, you'll see the contents of `~/.bashrc` which may or may not be empty. If it's empty, go ahead and paste in the contents we had you copy above. If it's not empty, paste in the contents *after* what is already there.

Save your changes in nano by hitting `ctrl` + `x`.

Nano will ask you if you want to *Save modified buffer*. Type the letter `y` to confirm that you do.

Nano will confirm what filename the changes will be saved to&mdash; in this case `.bashrc`. Hit enter to confirm the save.

Next, we need to edit `~/.bash_profile` and tell it to load `~/.bashrc`.

Open `~/.bash_profile` in nano:

```bash
$ sudo nano ~/.bash_profile
```

Paste in this code:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

Hit `ctrl` + `x` to save and exit.
Type the letter `y` to confirm you want to save.

__Close and re-open Terminal for the changes to take effect.__

If everything works, you should see this whenever you open Terminal:

Read through the template file, as it's well commented and explains everything it does.

That being said, below are some highlights. You don't need to do anything - as everything described is already set up for you in the given `.bashrc` template.






## Aliases
Aliases provide shortcuts to commonly used commands.

For example, in the template there's an alias called `ll` that calls the list command (`ls`) with commonly used flags (shows file types, colors the output, etc.):

```bash
alias ll="ls -laFG"
```

You can create aliases for commonly used commands, like SSH'ing into a server:

```bash
# Example alias for SSH'ing into a server
alias myserver="ssh user@111.111.111.111"
```

...Or getting to a frequently accessed directory:

```bash
# Example alias for quickly getting to a commonly used directory
alias htdocs='cd /Applications/MAMP/htdocs'
```

See the section under *Aliases* in the `.bashrc` file for full details.




## Prompt

The prompt is the line you see whenever CL is waiting for a command. In the template `.bashrc`, the prompt is configured to show you your current directory, plus, if you're in a directory that is a Git repository, it'll show you which branch you're on and if there are any changes to that branch.

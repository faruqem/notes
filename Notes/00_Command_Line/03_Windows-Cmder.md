## Windows - **Cmder**

<img src='http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/sysadmin-cmder@2x.png' style='max-width:920px; width:100%'>

*Cmder* is a Windows front-end for the standard Windows Command Shell (aka `cmd.exe`).

In this course, we'll use a special build of Cmder that has the following benefits/customizations:

+ Uses a version of Cmder that is tested across multiple systems
+ Includes a custom Git prompt
+ Includes [`elevate`](http://code.kliu.org/misc/elevate/) to easily run commands as an admin
+ Includes `nano`, a simple CL text editor

## Installing
Extract the downloaded `cmder-master.zip` file to `C:\Program Files` (Right click the zip file, Choose *Extract all*.)

Head's up: You have to be logged in as an admin to write to the Program Files directory. If you're not, you may receive an error that says something like: `Not permitted or able to create an output directory.`. To address this issue, log in as an admin or extract to a folder you do have write access to. A lot of what we do in this course will require admin privileges, though, so it's worth going through the effort of logging in as an admin.

Extraction may take a few minutes.

Within the resulting extracted folder `C:\Program Files\cmder-master\`, you'll see the Cmder icon you can use to launch the program.

That's all you need to do to get Cmder rolling. The rest of this doc includes some notes about how Cmder is customized, but requires no action on your part.




## Basic settings
Basic Cmder interface settings are done via (`Win + Alt + P`) the *Settings* menu found via the menu icon on the bottom right.




## Creating your own commands
Create new commands via text files with the `.bat` extension inside `bin/`.

For an example, see the `alias.bat` file that creates the `alias` command.




## Aliases
Run `alias help` for details

Aliases are stored in `config/aliases`

Run `alias name=full command` to create an alias, or edit `config/aliases`.




## Customizing the prompt
Done via `config/prompt.lua` or `config/git.lua` when you're in a git repository.
